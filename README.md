# The Relevance Vector Machine

This repository contains work for the project of the DD2434 Machine Learning, Advance Course for KTH's MSc Machine Learning programme. "The Relevance Vector Machine" is a re-implementation of the original RVM [work](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1719-the-relevance-vector-machine.pdf) from Michael E. Tipping. 

This work could not have been done without the help and collaboration of [Erifili Ichtiaroglou](https://github.com/erifili) and [George Zervakis](https://github.com/gonconist).
